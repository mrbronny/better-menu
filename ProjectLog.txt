My brother had this idea for a business-to-business model that is meant to serve small businesses in the food industry. 
He had made a mock-up user interface and I was able to identify the needed entities and attributes.
Together, we designed Better Menu's database structure from there.

Just getting the project set up and started. Being new to MySQL, there were some difficulties with actually writing the code.
Creating the tables and their attributes was arduous, and I didn't have much trouble with the syntax.
The sample queries tore me a new one, as I am still learning how JOINs work. Took me a while to get the data I wanted from a majority of the queries I created.
Overall, I'm satisfied with my initial progress and look forward to working on it further.
